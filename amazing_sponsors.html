				<h2>Our Sponsors</h2>
				<p>So far, we have three amazing sponsors:</p>
				<h3><a href="http://threefortynine.com">ThreeFortyNine</a></h3>
				<p>At <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=349+Woolwich+St,+Guelph,+ON+N1H+2A4,+Canada&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=55.849851,57.216797&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=349+Woolwich+St,+Guelph,+Wellington+County,+Ontario,+Canada&z=17">349 Woolwich</a> there is a beautiful house that code built. Inside, developers work away and make cool stuff, and they have for a long time. They realized that their resources could be shared, and that they could open up hitherto unused regions of their offices as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking">coworking</a> space for freelance coders and designers, small businesses, and ragtag superhero groups like our own. ThreeFortyNine has generously offered to let us work in their shared space - this would be impossible without them. We highly encourage that anyone in Guelph looking for somewhere to get their work done and use as a base of operations <a href="http://threefortynine.com">check them out</a>; they're very reasonable and super cool.</p>
			
				<h3><a href="http://uoguelph.ca/ccs">Computing & Communication Services</a></h3>
				<p>We're very excited to have the support of the University's computing organization. CCS is generously helping out with our food costs for the week. Thank you so much!</p>
				
				<h3><a href="http://sredunlimited.com">SREDUnlimited</a></h3>
				<p>The folks at SREDUnlimited saw our impromptu announcement at DemoCampGuelph and reached out to help. Thanks for supporting local tech initiatives! We couldn't be happier to have your support.</p>
				
				<h3>If you would like to be an amazing sponsor:</h3>
				<p>Please send us an <a href="mailto:guelphseven@gmail.com">email</a>! We'd love to discuss an arrangement.</p>
				<p>Your support is appreciated!</p>
				
				<h3>Please bear with us</h3>
				<p>This page is very young and will change a lot in layout, colour, and content over the next three weeks.</p>
				<p>Thank you for checking us out!</p>

				<h2>What's this all about?</h2>
				<p>In November of 2010, 7 Waterloo students worked for 7 days, to create 7 sweet apps and show off their skills. They enjoyed it so much that they're doing it again. We enjoyed the process and results so much that this time, we're joining them. Seven University of Guelph students will engage in friendly competition with a newly formed 7^3 dream team at Waterloo to make amazing applications.</p>
				<h2>When's it all happening?</h2>
				<p>From March 5th to 11th, we will be releasing one application per day. Leading up to that, we'll be posting short bios for each team member, performing a dry run, thanking sponsors profusely, and updating the world with our process. When the whole thing's over, we'll give a postmortem rundown and see what we've learned. Then we'll start to make plans for next time.</p>
				<h2>These can't be useful ideas!</h2>
				<p>Au contraire. Check out the original <a href="http://7cubedproject.com">7^3</a> site from November. There's tremendous utility there. Of course, we don't propose that we'll be making polished, perfect, never-ever-fail-on-your-life applications in a single day! We're going to follow cool thoughts through to completion and unleash awesome ideas onto the world, and then we can revisit whatever the world shows interest in, and flesh it out into an even better and more perfect product.</p>
				<h2>How can I help?</h2>
				<p>Sponsor us! We've already experienced the magnificent sponsorship of <a href="http://threefortynine.com">349</a>, who will provide us with space to do our amazing work in. We still need to find some way to eat during the week - 7 people need a fair amount of food, and cooking time is far better spent coding! Our friends in Waterloo have told us that roughly $1500 is a safe number to cover food and drink for a full week for seven, so that's the target we'd like to meet.</p>
				<h2>Cool; what else?</h2>
				<p>Follow us on <href="http://twitter.com/guelphseven">twitter</a> and watch our progress! Try out our apps as we release them, give us feedback by tweeting at us, blog about us, submit links to HackerNews and generally tell people about this! We're cool people and we'd like our names out there, and we're hoping our work finds success. More importantly though is this idea itself: taking some time away from whatever else you're doing just to create, to collaborate, and to grow as a developer and a designer is a fantastic exercise. We want to show people that they can pull off amazing things - they just have to get up and do them. Hopefully we'll have even more teams join in for another round in the future, and this crazy concept can spread like a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks">TED</a> idea.
