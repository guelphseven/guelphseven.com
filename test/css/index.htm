				<p>The Guelph Seven are officially off the ground - we've registered our domain, set a firm date, got an <a href="mailto:guelphseven@gmail.com">email</a>, and we even have a <a href="http://twitter.com/guelphseven">twitter</a>. Follow us.</p>
				<h3>What's happening</h3>
				<p>After a meeting this afternoon, we've solidified our identity, our workspace, and our web presence. The team discussed the skills we're each bringing to the table, and areas that we'd enjoy working in during our week. Each of us are active members of the campus community with lots of classes and meetings, so it's surprisingly difficult to get us all into a room!</p>

				<h2>What's this all about?</h2>
				<p>In November of 2010, 7 Waterloo students worked for 7 days, to create 7 sweet apps and show off their skills. They enjoyed it so much that they're doing it again. We enjoyed the process and results so much that this time, we're joining them. Seven University of Guelph students will engage in friendly competition with a newly formed 7^3 dream team at Waterloo to make amazing applications.</p>
				<h2>When's it all happening?</h2>
				<p>From March 5th to 11th, we will be releasing one application per day. Leading up to that, we'll be posting short bios for each team member, performing a dry run, thanking sponsors profusely, and updating the world with our process. When the whole thing's over, we'll give a postmortem rundown and see what we've learned. Then we'll start to make plans for next time.</p>
				<h2>These can't be useful ideas!</h2>
				<p>Au contraire. Check out the original <a href="http://7cubedproject.com">7^3</a> site from November. There's tremendous utility there. Of course, we don't propose that we'll be making polished, perfect, never-ever-fail-on-your-life applications in a single day! We're going to follow cool thoughts through to completion and unleash awesome ideas onto the world, and then we can revisit whatever the world shows interest in, and flesh it out into an even better and more perfect product.</p>
				<h2>How can I help?</h2>
				<p>Sponsor us! We've already experienced the magnificent sponsorship of <a href="http://guelphcoworking.com">349</a>, who will provide us with space to do our amazing work in. We still need to find some way to eat during the week - 7 people need a fair amount of food, and cooking time is far better spent coding! Our friends in Waterloo have told us that roughly $1500 is a safe number to cover food and drink for a full week for seven, so that's the target we'd like to meet.</p>
				<h2>Cool; what else?</h2>
				<p>Follow us on twitter and watch our progress! Try out our apps as we release them, give us feedback by tweeting at us, blog about us, submit links to HackerNews and generally tell people about this! We're cool people and we'd like our names out there, and we're hoping our work finds success. More importantly though is this idea itself: taking some time away from whatever else you're doing just to create, to collaborate, and to grow as a developer and a designer is a fantastic exercise. We want to show people that they can pull off amazing things - they just have to get up and do them. Hopefully we'll have even more teams join in for another round in the future, and this crazy concept can spread like a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks">TED</a> idea.
