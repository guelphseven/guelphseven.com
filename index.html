			<h2>In just under a month, 7 students will write 7 applications in 7 days.</h2>
			<p>We will come together, share ideas, share skills, and make amazing stuff. From March 5th to March 11th, we will publish regular stories while creating applications for the web, for developers, and for mobile devices.</p>
			<p>Our local rival the University of Waterloo will engage in friendly competition with us, while engaging in the same process on their end. We'll both have fun and work hard, and the result will hopefully be useful applications.</p>
			<p>Keep an eye on this site, and follow The Guelph Seven <a href="http://twitter.com/guelphseven">here!</a></p>
